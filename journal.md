My favorite game is maybe be gonna be fortnite because of the building mechanics. Even if I'm not that good on it, I like the way people use it for a misdirection way to add to their kill counts.

 My personal only challenges were that I mis-spelled the username for the google form you assigned to us with our github usernames. Other than that I would think the problems for other students is maybe the fact they have a VPN that could be blocking you from accessing the git hub usernames, or maybe they mis spelled their usernames on the form too like I did.

When using any coding language, accuracy and precision is very important because any miss spelled line or miss click coulld result in major errors or even the function breaking. It would happen to me a couple of times when I would be doing assignments on codehs last year. Or even miss spelling a word could result in major errors and in life computer scientists need to always be aware and "awake" because if in the moment needed most, and they mess up, it could be their job on the line. Accuracy and precision is required for any computer scientists.
