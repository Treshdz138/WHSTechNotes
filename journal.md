My favorite game is maybe be gonna be fortnite because of the building mechanics. Even if I'm not that good on it, I like the way people use it for a misdirection way to add to their kill counts.

Hi Ms. Whitby this is for the example you discussed with us during 5th period

 My personal only challenges were that I mis-spelled the username for the google form you assigned to us with our github usernames. Other than that I would think the problems for other students is maybe the fact they have a VPN that could be blocking you from accessing the git hub usernames, or maybe they mis spelled their usernames on the form too like I did.

When using any coding language, accuracy and precision is very important because any miss spelled line or miss click coulld result in major errors or even the function breaking. It would happen to me a couple of times when I would be doing assignments on codehs last year. Or even miss spelling a word could result in major errors and in life computer scientists need to always be aware and "awake" because if in the moment needed most, and they mess up, it could be their job on the line. Accuracy and precision is required for any computer scientists.

In todays time, computer science is very important and very common due to it being used for almost everything. Especially on everyones day to day items like phones, every app is made from computer science. Even cars have computer science used in them because new cars have new technologies that can help prevent accidents, or even make routes for someones destination. It helps me every day to contact my parents if I need to discuss something with them, or also helps me look at the weather for the day and even at certain times of the day.

The computer science career I researched is a software architect, which is the main person who organizes any software including the structure of it and etc. The main programming language they use is python and java, the minimum education needed to apply for this position is a bachelors in software engineering or anything in computer science as a bachelor. After 7-9 average years for experience as a software engineer, then reaching the position of software architect, there is nowhere else after that. This job relates to my future since I want to have a profession with both engineering, and computer science and start a business with this that can hopefully reach state wide, then nationwide.

Programming helps anyone with problem solving skills be taking normally large time consuming tasks, then taking that and turning it into smaller parts making it more completable parts. Even if someone doesn't pursue a programming career in life, the logical thinking and the creativity stays with that person and helps them for whatever they might wanna do. By learning programming, you take advice from others that want to collaborate and guide ypu which is how programming/ coding helps enhance collaboration. It can help with even business careered people, since it could help them to think outside of the box to find a new pitch or idea and maybe helps them work with their work teams.

AI is a very strong asset to our day and age since it can help look and answer questions for anything and maybe find an answer someone hasnt thought off yet. It also analyzes data into major details and with lots of precision just in case a real person is tired and misses something or they just forgot. Along with that it can help predict future outcomes using resources connected to past situations and maybe relate or connect them to the question the person asked the AI. Because of AI being very powerful and helping make someones job easier, it can even replace that worker, and since it would be saving costs other than paying a worker, it can replace people in manufacturing facilities or warehouses. The AI can even help someone with bads intentions take their personal information maybe like banks, or anythintg else personal of a person.

Probably the main positive impact I see in using technology for the elections could be using it to collect data and counting all votes to get an accurate poll. It can show where the votes were coming from to use as data for what states side with which political side. The negative thing I would assume, is that people could try to tamper with the votes by hacking into the system breaking into the cyber security system to rig it.

In today and all of the time, privacy is very important especially when publishing anything online now. It's crucial because if not careful, it can be seen by many people that might have bad intentions or disgusting ones. One step to keep github accounts safe and personal information is by keeping it private if you have personal info linked into your github. I've never leaked out my own personal info because I'm not clumsy to not only harm my own info and personal stuff, but maybe even my familys buisness. The main thing to keep balance is only you and that one person to know the information to login, passwords, etc.

A current event at the moment impacting everyone with a car in todays time, is gas prices. The prices compared to when I was around 10 (6 years ago), were around $1.99 and now are in the scale of $2.50-3 something. This relates to problem solving because people now have to adapt and maybe drive a bit farther to get cheaper gas or people switch to newer electric cars like tesas, etc. 
Computer science can help with making the electric cars more reliable and maybe even persuade buyers to switch from gasoline cars to electric. During these prices nowadays, it's a great time for someone to switch to electtric cars because of a main problem being the gas prices.

Of course technology has gotten to the point it can take over a human beings job, and d=saving the costs to pay that person, picking crops at the perfect time if their algorithm is correct and flawless. Sebsors monitoring the health of the produce in the fields taking in information to whether it needs more water, or whatever it may be. And advancing the proccess of moving grocceries or foods is wioth doordash or uber eats, updating routes and having the ability to update the customer where the food is and even if they need to call them for even a minor detail to tell the driver.

I have recently found out that the STAAR tests are now graded by artificial intelligence. The AI does most of the the grading for the test, then real people do the rest of it that the AI has declared as uncertain so the person does the final decision over those "uncertain" questions. I do think it's impressive but also seen as lazy and can be a problem, also recently I've heard of a google based AI that replied to a kid that he should "despose of hhis parents" after he said "what do I do if my parents caught me taking money, or something similar to that topic. AI for the STAAR tests could maybe not see the overall school systems "right" from what the AI graded it towards. (The Texas Tribute)

The word brain rot in my opinion means an overused term from todays social medias standpoint. Mainly by people younger than highschool freshman is what comes to mind when i think of the words "Brain Rot." It doesn't bother my personal mental well being and neither does social media. I do think it can be both neagtive and positive because it can inflict cetain positive or negative thoughts to people and without telling the whole story because on the internet, there can't always be a true story or be told all the info. For the younger generation I think it is possible to limit it or balance out the interaction of seeing "brain rot" related things because there are parental controls and on mpst social media there is a button to say "I am not interested in this related stuff" to command the apps and software to not show anything similar to whatever the post or video was.

I am very much looking towards winter break, and my birthday (January 3rd.)

# January 10, 2025
I love the self pace we have for this class where I can learn how to use unity at my own pace and no deadlines and where I can essentially make whatever I want. I'm more excited to learn anything in general, it can hopefully help later on with my career to expand my portfolio. I don't mind any certifications, it'll just help me grow what I can do for later on in my life and career.

I wasn't at school while we watched the moneyball movie, Ms. Whitby said I was excused from this assignment because I wouldn't be at school because I'm a "good noodle", and because I would be away for school purposes.

With the recent Tiktok ban that only last a couple of hours, it could've still greatly affected tech companies with connections towards tiktom because that means the greatest social media platform in todays age isn't being used by many people in the United States, no usage of the companys tech, means no money. The reason the government banned the app involves a invasion of  privacy because it can tap into the users phone and wifi. I would say if I had a career at TikTok I would try to figure out a way to limit the connection to the app required to connect to the wifi.
