My favorite game is maybe be gonna be fortnite because of the building mechanics. Even if I'm not that good on it, I like the way people use it for a misdirection way to add to their kill counts.

Hi Ms. Whitby this is for the example you discussed with us during 5th period

 My personal only challenges were that I mis-spelled the username for the google form you assigned to us with our github usernames. Other than that I would think the problems for other students is maybe the fact they have a VPN that could be blocking you from accessing the git hub usernames, or maybe they mis spelled their usernames on the form too like I did.

When using any coding language, accuracy and precision is very important because any miss spelled line or miss click coulld result in major errors or even the function breaking. It would happen to me a couple of times when I would be doing assignments on codehs last year. Or even miss spelling a word could result in major errors and in life computer scientists need to always be aware and "awake" because if in the moment needed most, and they mess up, it could be their job on the line. Accuracy and precision is required for any computer scientists.

In todays time, computer science is very important and very common due to it being used for almost everything. Especially on everyones day to day items like phones, every app is made from computer science. Even cars have computer science used in them because new cars have new technologies that can help prevent accidents, or even make routes for someones destination. It helps me every day to contact my parents if I need to discuss something with them, or also helps me look at the weather for the day and even at certain times of the day.

The computer science career I researched is a software architect, which is the main person who organizes any software including the structure of it and etc. The main programming language they use is python and java, the minimum education needed to apply for this position is a bachelors in software engineering or anything in computer science as a bachelor. After 7-9 average years for experience as a software engineer, then reaching the position of software architect, there is nowhere else after that. This job relates to my future since I want to have a profession with both engineering, and computer science and start a business with this that can hopefully reach state wide, then nationwide.

Programming helps anyone with problem solving skills be taking normally large time consuming tasks, then taking that and turning it into smaller parts making it more completable parts. Even if someone doesn't pursue a programming career in life, the logical thinking and the creativity stays with that person and helps them for whatever they might wanna do. By learning programming, you take advice from others that want to collaborate and guide ypu which is how programming/ coding helps enhance collaboration. It can help with even business careered people, since it could help them to think outside of the box to find a new pitch or idea and maybe helps them work with their work teams.

AI is a very strong asset to our day and age since it can help look and answer questions for anything and maybe find an answer someone hasnt thought off yet. It also analyzes data into major details and with lots of precision just in case a real person is tired and misses something or they just forgot. Along with that it can help predict future outcomes using resources connected to past situations and maybe relate or connect them to the question the person asked the AI. Because of AI being very powerful and helping make someones job easier, it can even replace that worker, and since it would be saving costs other than paying a worker, it can replace people in manufacturing facilities or warehouses. The AI can even help someone with bads intentions take their personal information maybe like banks, or anythintg else personal of a person.
