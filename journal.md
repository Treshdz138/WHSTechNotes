My favorite game is maybe be gonna be fortnite because of the building mechanics. Even if I'm not that good on it, I like the way people use it for a misdirection way to add to their kill counts.

Hi Ms. Whitby this is for the example you discussed with us during 5th period

# September 12, 2024
 My personal only challenges were that I mis-spelled the username for the google form you assigned to us with our github usernames. Other than that I would think the problems for other students is maybe the fact they have a VPN that could be blocking you from accessing the git hub usernames, or maybe they mis spelled their usernames on the form too like I did.

When using any coding language, accuracy and precision is very important because any miss spelled line or miss click coulld result in major errors or even the function breaking. It would happen to me a couple of times when I would be doing assignments on codehs last year. Or even miss spelling a word could result in major errors and in life computer scientists need to always be aware and "awake" because if in the moment needed most, and they mess up, it could be their job on the line. Accuracy and precision is required for any computer scientists.

In todays time, computer science is very important and very common due to it being used for almost everything. Especially on everyones day to day items like phones, every app is made from computer science. Even cars have computer science used in them because new cars have new technologies that can help prevent accidents, or even make routes for someones destination. It helps me every day to contact my parents if I need to discuss something with them, or also helps me look at the weather for the day and even at certain times of the day.

The computer science career I researched is a software architect, which is the main person who organizes any software including the structure of it and etc. The main programming language they use is python and java, the minimum education needed to apply for this position is a bachelors in software engineering or anything in computer science as a bachelor. After 7-9 average years for experience as a software engineer, then reaching the position of software architect, there is nowhere else after that. This job relates to my future since I want to have a profession with both engineering, and computer science and start a business with this that can hopefully reach state wide, then nationwide.

Programming helps anyone with problem solving skills be taking normally large time consuming tasks, then taking that and turning it into smaller parts making it more completable parts. Even if someone doesn't pursue a programming career in life, the logical thinking and the creativity stays with that person and helps them for whatever they might wanna do. By learning programming, you take advice from others that want to collaborate and guide ypu which is how programming/ coding helps enhance collaboration. It can help with even business careered people, since it could help them to think outside of the box to find a new pitch or idea and maybe helps them work with their work teams.

AI is a very strong asset to our day and age since it can help look and answer questions for anything and maybe find an answer someone hasnt thought off yet. It also analyzes data into major details and with lots of precision just in case a real person is tired and misses something or they just forgot. Along with that it can help predict future outcomes using resources connected to past situations and maybe relate or connect them to the question the person asked the AI. Because of AI being very powerful and helping make someones job easier, it can even replace that worker, and since it would be saving costs other than paying a worker, it can replace people in manufacturing facilities or warehouses. The AI can even help someone with bads intentions take their personal information maybe like banks, or anythintg else personal of a person.

Probably the main positive impact I see in using technology for the elections could be using it to collect data and counting all votes to get an accurate poll. It can show where the votes were coming from to use as data for what states side with which political side. The negative thing I would assume, is that people could try to tamper with the votes by hacking into the system breaking into the cyber security system to rig it. 

# November 4, 2024
In today and all of the time, privacy is very important especially when publishing anything online now. It's crucial because if not careful, it can be seen by many people that might have bad intentions or disgusting ones. One step to keep github accounts safe and personal information is by keeping it private if you have personal info linked into your github. I've never leaked out my own personal info because I'm not clumsy to not only harm my own info and personal stuff, but maybe even my familys buisness. The main thing to keep balance is only you and that one person to know the information to login, passwords, etc. 

# November 14, 2024
A current event at the moment impacting everyone with a car in todays time, is gas prices. The prices compared to when I was around 10 (6 years ago), were around $1.99 and now are in the scale of $2.50-3 something. This relates to problem solving because people now have to adapt and maybe drive a bit farther to get cheaper gas or people switch to newer electric cars like tesas, etc. 
Computer science can help with making the electric cars more reliable and maybe even persuade buyers to switch from gasoline cars to electric. During these prices nowadays, it's a great time for someone to switch to electtric cars because of a main problem being the gas prices.

Of course technology has gotten to the point it can take over a human beings job, and d=saving the costs to pay that person, picking crops at the perfect time if their algorithm is correct and flawless. Sebsors monitoring the health of the produce in the fields taking in information to whether it needs more water, or whatever it may be. And advancing the proccess of moving grocceries or foods is wioth doordash or uber eats, updating routes and having the ability to update the customer where the food is and even if they need to call them for even a minor detail to tell the driver.

I have recently found out that the STAAR tests are now graded by artificial intelligence. The AI does most of the the grading for the test, then real people do the rest of it that the AI has declared as uncertain so the person does the final decision over those "uncertain" questions. I do think it's impressive but also seen as lazy and can be a problem, also recently I've heard of a google based AI that replied to a kid that he should "despose of hhis parents" after he said "what do I do if my parents caught me taking money, or something similar to that topic. AI for the STAAR tests could maybe not see the overall school systems "right" from what the AI graded it towards. (The Texas Tribute)

The word brain rot in my opinion means an overused term from todays social medias standpoint. Mainly by people younger than highschool freshman is what comes to mind when i think of the words "Brain Rot." It doesn't bother my personal mental well being and neither does social media. I do think it can be both neagtive and positive because it can inflict cetain positive or negative thoughts to people and without telling the whole story because on the internet, there can't always be a true story or be told all the info. For the younger generation I think it is possible to limit it or balance out the interaction of seeing "brain rot" related things because there are parental controls and on mpst social media there is a button to say "I am not interested in this related stuff" to command the apps and software to not show anything similar to whatever the post or video was.

I am very much looking towards winter break, and my birthday (January 3rd.)

I love the self pace we have for this class where I can learn how to use unity at my own pace and no deadlines and where I can essentially make whatever I want. I'm more excited to learn anything in general, it can hopefully help later on with my career to expand my portfolio. I don't mind any certifications, it'll just help me grow what I can do for later on in my life and career. 

# January 15, 2025
I wasn't at school while we watched the moneyball movie, Ms. Whitby said I was excused from this assignment because I wouldn't be at school because I'm a "good noodle", and because I would be away for school purposes. 

# January 22, 2025
With the recent Tiktok ban that only last a couple of hours, it could've still greatly affected tech companies with connections towards tiktom because that means the greatest social media platform in todays age isn't being used by many people in the United States, no usage of the companys tech, means no money. The reason the government banned the app involves a invasion of  privacy because it can tap into the users phone and wifi. I would say if I had a career at TikTok I would try to figure out a way to limit the connection to the app required to connect to the wifi.

Computer science contriubutes to aviation traveling or anything related to aviation by having such things as sensors with the flying object or plane, help with providing clear communication between airports and the plane or authorities. Computer science also protects planes while in flight from people trying to hack or jam the system and helps it with alsmost everything the plane has.

The main feature in my app for a team would be to identify the opponents past year plays and match them with one our own teams plays that'll work best to go against. Another feature would be a play maker like an ai generator that makes plays to counter each team in the league. The algorithms would be very crucial to the structure of any code. A dash board for the app would consist of plays for each team including updates about any injured player lists, or even upcoming trades for whatever team you're playing next.

The most interesting thing I learned from last week was probably how to fix a hole in the wall, it was ery interesting and not as complicated as I thought it would be.

The most technology I used was just on my phone and through social media, playing games like clash royale or talking to family and my friends, or also looking and learning about some robots tesla has in the development proccess at the moment. My phone does for sure help me "stay in the know" of whats happening during these times and get inspiration and ideas for what I'd like to make for this class or in engineering.

I think AI predictions and calculations for march madness can be accurate but even when it comes to the end of march madness it could be risky since people are willing to do anything to help benefit their own team. Social media can alter the audiences view on march madness or on any sports, increasin amounts of love or hatred towards certain players or teams spreading rumors or truths about anyone involved on the teams.

I'm doing pretty good, mentally, emotionally, and physically. For me the most stressful part is maintaining straight a's for the school so I can get into a good college. For me I like to studym hard work pays off for me, how I like to stay motivated is wanting to have a big house when I graduate from college with no college debt as well. Once I'm able to comfortably travel to monaco casually I'll know I've made it in my life.

# April 11, 2025
I think AI could help students study ro the state standard tests, but to an extent because now even the STAAR tests are graded by AI. And AI isn't 100% guarenteed full proof but it's almost there, hopefully soon. I think the most used feature of AI that would be used is giving a more simplified version of answers or even "short n sweet" summaries to help kids memorized materials for the STAAR tests. 

# April 17, 2025
I think the banning of phones in school is good and bad in different topics. 20 years ago, how often was it to have a school shooter anywhere in the United States... Now, very sadly, there are school shootings that aren't "once in a million" like it used to be. My parents even said they don't remember ever hearing of any school shooting from when they weree in highschool in the 2000's, and my family's from the town next to Uvalde that nbo one knew that place existed, till recently. If students have their phones they can tell the parents on the spot before the school even tells their kids parents. In any emergency the kids tell their parents right away and that is a huge pro of kids having thei phones with them during school. A pro of taking away phones does help raise attention for class work and would help raise grades. I would be worried about everyones safety if the school takes away our devices because there are times were people make threats in our school on social media platforms, and the problem is fixed in a matter of minutes because a student brings immediate attention to the school or district and that student has their pgone with them during the normal school day.

I think it depends on if the people are chosen specifically or if they're just random people bevause if I get to choose who it is then the 100 people are absolutely winning. I don't think this is an important topic unless planet of the apes was real but it is something fun and interesting that proves how fast and big something get get word of mouth but virtually.

This chal;lenge about destropying property that isn't yours is absurd and quite dumb... That's not only destroying something thats not yours but also something that someone spent hours to make and is what helps others when needed. People use those devices to keep up their grades and damaging it is just damaging their own personal record. 

# May 19, 2025
I'm very excited for the summer because now that I drive and since I also have a good job, I can go out and even go places with some extent of flexibility. I'm gonna have a lot of fun and also do a lot to enjoy my highschool years which are considered the best years of someones life. I can't wait to get closer to becoming a college student/ adult.

# September 2, 2025
So far the phone law isn't that bad as people make it seem to be, I'm adjusting to it farely well I only have a couple of wishes like were that we could have them during our designated lunchs and during passing period to listen to music. And that it's not possible to text or call my parents/family if something were to bring danger towards us and potential harm. 

# September 8, 2025
For me I want to go to college for business and I know that computer science can be very useful in this field because it can give data driven answers to help any brand/company. I've seen it even at my jobwhere they ask AI or try to use computer science to help with work and help simplify it. My dad says that at his job they insist in using AI or computer science related things to help shorten the time to do certain things for daily work life.It especially improves communication or moving around schedules for me at work because everything I need for work is on an app. My schedule, if I wanted to trade shifts with someone, if I neeed to find a certain product what aisle it's in, how many are left, and even what sub section or shelf it's on. Computer science is the future in my opinion.

# September 16, 2025
My idea for this AI challenge presented by the white house is an app/ device powered by AI that can track active trains or even cargo boats or ships. Reason is that there are 214,000 active railroads in the United States used by trains that cause major traffic. It doesn't help anyones day because you can't track it or anything. What if there was an app that was able to not only track all the trains on a map showing them where they are at that exact moment. But it would use AI to show new routes to avoid thatv traffic from that railroad crossing. Same also applies with cargo ships or boats in even the state of Louisiana.

I personally don't think a virtual job type of thing is good in terms of people actually working in ikea would make them loose their jobs. I think it is very interesting to look into and it's pretty cool but I personally don't think it's like very promising compared to working in the Ikea store itself.

# September 30, 2025
The phrase 6 7 is in my opinion an odd "cultural norm" that the younger people are saying and have been saying for the past couple of months. The phrase us originally from a rappers song where he ends the verse saying "six seveeeeeen" and then later after the song was published at an AAU basketball game one of the more popular players made a layup, a bystander makes the comment "six seveeeeen" and with a weird hand gesture. It is used for honestly anything, even if it means getting a laugh out of a person or friend. I personally don't like this phrase because there is no meaning to it other than a rapper said this in their song... I'm personally annoyed of it, especially for it going on for so long now.

# October 6, 2025 
If I were in charge of our school there would be some changes in certain thats accessible on school grounds. First the phone ban would stay, but the times of day they can be used is during a students designated lunch, during passing periods/ bathroom breaks, or even shutdown days this phone ban wouldn't be enforced. No AI's would be permitted unless it was one developed by the school itself and monitored by them too. I think this would lower the disliking feeling students have of going to school and the ai reduction could help people with studying increasing grades, and lower the cheating usage.

"Design a single-page educational poster explaining photosynthesis for 7th-grade science students. The poster must feature a central, detailed diagram of a plant leaf and cross-section, clearly labeling the inputs ($\text{Water}$ and $\text{Carbon Dioxide}$) and outputs ($\text{Oxygen}$ and $\text{Glucose}$). Include a separate, smaller section detailing the role of chlorophyll and how it absorbs sunlight. Use a modern, bright, and illustrated design style with a green and blue color palette. Ensure all scientific terms are bolded and the overall look is clean, professional, and easy to read from a distance." This prompt designed by canva ai is personally very effective and does cut time needed to make by so very much. This came out just as I had expected.
